<strong>sthalapuranam</strong>

one legend says that this temple is protruding between kudamurutti and kavery rivers and hence it is given the name thiruppoonthuruthi. thuruthi in means the land thats jutting out. the adjective 'poo' is added since this place was a big flower garden.

flowers are supplied for the saptha sthanam festival here.

it is said that kaali worshipped the lord to get rid of the mahisha dosham for killing mahishasura here.

sage kaashyapa brought ganga water in the temple well to perform abishekam to the lord.

this temple is known for 'pithru saaba nivarthi' , meaning it cures troubles arising out from ancestral issues.

this is where appar , one of the thevaram saints hid underneath the palanquin to carry sambandhar , another saint. appar also sung many hymns in praise of the lord during his stay here. the place where he stayed is still here called appar matam.

thiruppoonthuruthi&nbsp;dates back to about 1600 years. it must have existed before that. cauvery flows to the north of the temple and kudamurutti to the south.

other temples which form the saptha sthanam heritage are kandiyur , thiruvedhikudi , thiruvaiyaru , thirupparanam , thiruchchotruthurai and thillaisthanam .&nbsp;
