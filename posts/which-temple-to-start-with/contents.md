When writer Bharanidharan who was famous writing in Vikatan magazine in the 60s and 70s went to Kanchi Swamigal Sri Chandrashekarendhra Saraswathi and asked him what next , he told him to write about temples. 

A little confused, when he asked him how and where to start from, the mighty Periyava aka Kanchi Peetadhipathi at that time suggested him to start from 
<b>Kudavasal</b> , a very small town along kumbakonam - thiruvarur road. 

Both where and How are in the 2 images shared above. The elegance of that old text ( a book we dont know ) is pretty compelling reason to start with Kudavasal !
