This 1000+ year old temple ( and many others we serve ) once echoed with chants. Today, its walls crumble silently, with no funds even for oil 🪔 or incense due to neglect and relentless attack on our civilisation from foreign players and their local agents. 

We cannot see them degenerate silently. Your contribution brings warmth to abandoned shrines and hope to forgotten keepers.

A contribution of say ₹300, lights lamps in a mid sized temple for 2 days fyi.
