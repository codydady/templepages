Temples like these once echoed with chants and was full of life in their heydays. Today, their walls crumble silently, with not many visiting, with no funds even for oil 🪔 or incense due to neglect and relentless attack on our civilisation from foreign players and their local agents. 

We cannot see them degenerate silently. Your contribution brings warmth to abandoned temples and hope to forgotten keepers.

NithyaDharma Charitable Trust was started to cater these functions atleast meet their basic demands like Oil, Vibhuthi etc and/or perform reccurring festivals like Pradosham, Kruththikai, Shankata Hara Chathurthi etc. What started as individual contribution became a trust as interested friends and colleagues also wanted to pitch in!

If you would like to contribute, pay to 7695803124@upi ( NithyaDharma Charitable Trust ) from any UPI app or scan the qr code provided below. You may whatsapp 7695803124 with details so you will be notified when your contribution is used. 🙏

      About the author..<br>
      I am Sriram Seetharaman, a software consultant by profession and passionate about our tradition and dharma. I have been visiting temples for more than 30 years and have personally visited over 2000 temples, mostly within the state of Tamil Nadu. I have seen the way temples are kept, their struggles and the plight of the people that still serve them with a ray of hope that the served will serve them one day.<br>
