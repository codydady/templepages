Namaskar,

Amidst incessant distractions from external media, the yearning for true happiness often slips the conscious thought. What ensues is a vicious cycle of endless consumption of content we don't need with time we don't have. It tires both physically and mentally. 

Unlike brute faith, Contemplation and Self Reflection are core Sanathanic traits. Without Gurus, we need some help illuminating a path towards a more mindful journey. Nithya Dharma Mobile App is a small step from us to be your technological agent!

Consuming is plodding whereas Dharma is momentous. It paves way for happiness.
