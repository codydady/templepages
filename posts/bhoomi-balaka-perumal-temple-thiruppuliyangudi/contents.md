Bhooma devi, after waiting for a long time for vishnu to come to her, did not see that happening since he was having a good time with lakshmi. Angered, she went to pathala lokam. It is said that vishnu went to pathala loka to console and get her back. Then both the consorts gave darshan together to deities.

Vasishta rishi's son shakthi rishi cursed a brahmin by name yagnasarma to be an asura since the latter did not respect the rishi. When yagna sharma asked for relief, shakthi said when indran comes to this place for penance, you will bother him. At that time vishnu will come to destroy you. When you are hit with his gatha, you will be cured. As forecasted, the story happened at a later time, and yagnasharma got cured of his curse.

There could be other sthala puranams, but we don't know much as of now.
