<strong>sthalapuranam</strong>

it is said that when bramma became headstrong about his creation prowess , murugan came here to teach him a lesson severing his 5th head making him nan-mukan ( in tamir meaning 4 faces ) and locked him in an iron room. in tamir iron room is irumbarai ( irumbu - iron , arai - room ), the name of the village. people wrongly call this irumborai ( with a 'o' ) some times.

it is said then shivan came to the rescue of bramma upon latter' plea releasing him from the iron prison.

<strong>shivan came alone , so no ambal sannidhi here !!</strong>

everyone on their way to othimalai should visit this small temple on the way. ask for directions in the village.&nbsp; the sons of the priest here are serving in othimalai murugan temple.
