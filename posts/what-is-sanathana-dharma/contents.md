## Sanatana Dharma: The Brain's lokamotiv to the Soul

We are bombarded with criticism that **Sanatana Dharma**—the heart of Hinduism—is a divisive, oppressive, "evil system" forced upon the masses by Brahmins. Yet, a crucial detail is often missed: most critics have never truly studied it.

This raises a stark question: How could such an intellectually rigorous, yet allegedly oppressive, system survive millennia? Were our ancestors truly that gullible?

The confusion stems from a fundamental error: equating **Dharma** with Western **Religion**.

### The Culture of *Seeking* vs. The Culture of *Faith*

Western culture, shaped by **Church and State**, emphasized **Faith**. Belief was paramount, logic secondary. This model, often primitive and later refined for imperialistic ends, offered *easy answers* to satisfy a "pleasure-seeking" populace.

West’s imperialistic ways meant it had a good administrative apparatus and that was often misconstrued for a better culture. At best it could be termed loosely as lifestyle. It was savage for the most part. Greece was one nuanced exception. Successful imperialistic times were seen as ‘Better days’.

Ancient Bharat, with its abundance and relative isolation, had multiple thriving civilizations and developed a different approach: **Dharma and State**.

* **The State** categorized people by *duty* (Varna)—a functional system where roles were neither superior nor inferior as peddled by barbaric whites but just based on occupation.

* **The Dharma** was unique: not a religion, but a continuous process of seeking.

This system was the civilization's pinnacle — a meticulously crafted machine to progress the soul.

### Dharma: A Guidebook for Advancement

Dharma was the guidebook for societal and personal advancement and interestingly not devised by one group of individuals or a monotheist god. It was continuous refinement by selfless gurus. It encouraged seekers to philosophize, debate, and validate logic. This constant scrutiny ensured a shorter correction cycle, where the *quantum of belief was kept to a minimum* before a truth was established as *fact*.

When logic was exhausted, the seeker was guided toward **experience** through meditation and internal reflection. Gurus were respected not just for *wisdom*, but also for *clearing the path*.

All the ways to conduct one’s life so it was conducive to seeking, methods to apply, help to advance one’s own methods, guiding when in doubt is Dharma.

Sanatana Dharma transcended/offered diverse spiritual paths ( place/group specific deities that existed before the enveloping dharmic system was developed), all designed to move the participant from **faith** to **belief** and finally, to **direct experience**.

### The Downfall: Power vs. Purity

The West, committed to hegemony and an administrative-military approach, did not grasp this intricate setup. They broadbrushed religious practices of Bharath into the term Hinduism. They viewed Dharma either as primitive ritual or "Brahminical fascism" — an intellectual threat to their control. They needed to alienate the guardians of Dharma. Trampling was okay. 
By west we mean all religious/dogmatic ways developed outside the subcontinent. These outsiders who hate each other intensely and fought wars for supremacy elsewhere would become strange bedfellows to start a relentless campaign to disengage the guardians

The subsequent introduction of new colonial administrative jobs, which literate Bharatiyas (including Brahmins) quickly excelled at, was weaponized. A narrative was created: the "upper caste" was hogging government jobs, leading to resentment and the eventual formation of ideological war-cries like **Dravidam**. With the intellectual class alienated or scattered, the system decayed into ritualism and materialism, demoting society from its pinnacle of **seeking** to a mere **mercantile existence**.

### Rectification: The Quest for Supreme Knowledge

Western masters are gone, but their ideological distortions remain.

The key to restoration is understanding this core truth: **Dharma is everyone’s exercise**. Material gain only creates horizontal *accumulation* and *suffering*. Only the quest for supreme knowledge, guided by Dharma, can extricate us from the sorrow of our plodding existence and lead us upward.

With the dark depths of the heart disgruntled with the remission seemingly brought about by faith and demand answers, at wit’s end, only dharma in its sincerest attempts provide wherever he may be in the seekers path, a quantum of deliverance, a ray of light.

We, the inheritors, must vividly understand and practice this, abolish all caste discrimination, and restore the vital catalysts aka temples of this great tradition.

**Sanatana Dharma is Bharat’s priceless gift to mankind. It deserves to be preserved.**
