<strong>Temple legend aka Sthalapuranam</strong>

It is said that about 700 years ago, a villager belonging to the native tribe came up to the mountain top in search for kizhangu ( edible root ) and dug the ground with an iron rod.

He by mistake was hitting a shivalingam and spontaneously lost his eyesight. knowing that he has hit something divine he prayed to shiva to get his eyesight back. It is said that he got his eyesight back when the lord ordered him to create a temple to worship.

The mark is still seen on the deity and also on the Nandhi. Villagers here have a belief that when they apply ghee to the nandhi where the mark is and if it turns yellow , it marks bad times ahead. whereas if the ghee or butter retains the original color, everything will be good.
