<strong>sthalapuranam</strong>

kashyapa rishi had two wives, karthru and vinata. since they were childless, both karthru and vinata prayed to shiva to be granted the boon. lord shiva gave them an egg each and told them to preserve their feminity in them and wait for them to hatch.

at the right time the egg given to vinatha hatched and garudan came out. looking at this karthru broke her egg hurriedly only to see a disfigured child in it. thus arunan, the child does not have lower body parts.

karthru understanding the consequences of her action prayed to shiva to restore her child. arunan was praying to shiva as well.

surya however was mocking arunan for his disfigurement and joked how he could reach the abode of shiva with such a condition. a determined arunan continued his penance and finally got the darshan of shiva. shiva granted arunans wishes and cursed surya to lose some of his brightness. so surya lost his brightness and worships shiva during the month of chaitra for a week.

shiva made aruna the charioteer of surya and made the first part of suryodayam called arunodayam.
