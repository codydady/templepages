This is the 10th revision ever since I started this in the year 2000 !! 

Bharath , the holy land which we call home has contributed to humanity in every materialistic discipline to lead a complete life to perhaps the most important gift it gave to the world, spirituality.

Even today, india is looked up for its unparalleled system of spirituality and that wisdom it manifested.  the most important avenue of all is temples.
Temples are very powerful centers of science and spirituality which can help remove the veil of ignorance in an individual and put him on path to wisdom and enlightenment.

in spite of brute destruction they suffered at the hands of foreign primitives , these wonders stand even today , few in good shape and most in a very neglected and dilapidated state hidden in remote villages.
